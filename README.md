# Introduction to Java Programming

This repository contains proposed solutions to exercises from the excellent (in my opinion)
textbook:

+ *Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures*, 12th edition, by Y. Daniel Liang.

If you notice any errors or have suggestions to improve the code, please let me know 🙂

**Note:** I am using Temurin JDK 21 (by the Eclipse Foundation), and the code is adapted to take advantage of Java 21 features.

## Content by Chapter (so far)

+ Chapter 7 – Single-Dimensional Arrays
